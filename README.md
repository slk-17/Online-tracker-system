# Order-tracker-system
An order tracking system allows the customer to gain insight into where their order is at any given point in time. From the time an order is placed until it is delivered. That means an order tracking system needs to be able to follow and provide insight into the status of the order through its entire journey in the Google map to the customer until it reaches to customer door.
